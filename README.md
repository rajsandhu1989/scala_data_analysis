# scala_data_analysis
This is a project where we are going to study the history of Scala project using data provided in the Git and Github websites.

First of all we have to read the data. All data fetch from Scala website is stored as csv files in the dataset folder in the folder of this notebook. csv files are as follows:

pulls_2011-2013.csv contains the basic information about the pull requests, and spans from the end of 2011 up to (but not including) 2014.

pulls_2014-2018.csv contains identical information, and spans from 2014 up to 2018.

pull_files.csv contains the files that were modified by each pull request.
